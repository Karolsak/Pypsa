attribute,type,unit,default,description,status
name,string,n/a,n/a,Unique name,Input (required)
bus0,string,n/a,n/a,"Name of first bus to which logical branch is attached. Note: If there are only logical elements attached to bus0, it is no part of the admittance matrix and therefore does not only (and must) exist in network.buses before initiating logical elements.",Input (required)
bus1,string,n/a,n/a,"Name of second bus to which logical branch is attached. Note: If there are only logical elements attached to bus1, it is no part of the admittance matrix and therefore does only (and must) exist in network.buses before initiating logical elements.",Input (required)
i_max,float,kA,n/a,"Maximum allowed current. The main idea is to use it for fuses, but switches do have this attribute too. This attribute is not used by PyPSA.,Input (optional)",
status,int,n/a,1,If status==0 the logical element is open if status==1 it is closed. Changing the status will not change the network topology. The functions network.close_switches(switches) and network.open_switches(switches) can be used to close or open the logical elements of choice and determine the resulting topology. Note: You may also change the status and then call network.switching() to apply all status of logical elements and determine the resulting topology.,Output
bus_connected,string,n/a,n/a,Name of the bus that is used to connect electrical components that are attached to bus0 and bus1 when status==1. This attribute is set by PyPSA in the function network.determine_logical_topology(); do not set it directly by hand.,Output
